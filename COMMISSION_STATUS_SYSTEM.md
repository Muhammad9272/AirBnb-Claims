# Influencer Commission Status System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive 4-status commission workflow for influencer management with manual payment processing from admin dashboard.

## Commission Status Flow

### Status Definitions
1. **Pending** - Commission created when claim is submitted, awaiting admin review
2. **Approved** - Admin has approved the commission, awaiting manual payment transfer
3. **Rejected** - Admin has rejected the commission (not eligible for payment)
4. **Paid** - Admin has confirmed manual payment transfer to influencer

### Status Workflow

## API Endpoints

### Admin Commission Management
```
GET  /management0712/influencers/commissions/list
POST /management0712/influencers/commissions/{id}/status
     - Body: { status: 'approved'|'rejected', notes: 'optional' }
POST /management0712/influencers/commissions/{id}/mark-paid

## Support Notes

For manual transfers, admins should:
1. Process payment through their preferred method
2. Keep transaction receipt/confirmation
3. Enter transaction ID in "Payment Reference" field
4. This creates audit trail for accounting

Commission lifecycle is now transparent with 4 clear stages that match real-world manual payment workflow.
